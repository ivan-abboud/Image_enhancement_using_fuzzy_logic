# Color Image Enhancement Using the Support Fuzzification in the Framework of the Logarithmic Model 

This is an implementation of [Color Image Enhancement Using the Support Fuzzification in the Framework of the Logarithmic Model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237202014_Color_Image_Enhancement_Using_the_Support_Fuzzification_in_the_Framework_of_the_Logarithmic_Model)


### Prerequisites
- cv2
- numpy
- scipy


### Running code
main.py contains all what you need

assign the global variable n,m and gamma as you wish

assign the img_name variable with the image file name(without extension) you want to enahance (by default it should bee a PNG file but you can change the code in the functions: colored_enhancing() , gray_enhancing())

finally, calling the function:

colored_enhancing() for enhancing colored images (obviously)

gray_enhancing() for enhancing gray images


### Note
all image files must be located at .\project_folder\test_images
